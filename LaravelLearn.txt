Resources folder of the project contains the views for the project

Web.php is where we load in views and controllers
For creating api's the api.php would be used 

extensions for laravel development (laravel blade snippets, php name resolver)

Usually data goes through a model in laravel there's a orm called eloquent which means object relational mapper
it basically maps data to objects. We get data from a database and then we just cast it into an object which then 
we can manipulate in whichever way we want

Migration is something that autogenerates code for controlling database tables. So basically when it's ran it creates tables
you create migrations by running command php artisan make:migration create_name_table and it will create a migration which then you edit
then run php artisan migrate to create tables and such

you can SEED your database by running php artisan db:seed. you will create fake records. 
If you want to refresh the whole db you can do that by running php migrate:refresh
or php migrate:refresh --seed to then also seeed db
